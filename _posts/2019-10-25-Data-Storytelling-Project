title: Data Storytelling Project
subtitle: A look into money and politics

For my first project at Lambda School I took a peak into the relationship between money and our elected representatives. Using data 
from the Center for Responsive Politics I was able to compile a medium-sized dataset containing almost 50,000 unique values. One highlight 
the project was its feature engineering, which I explain more in the [Medium post](https://medium.com/@BrianThomasRoss/want-to-get-rich-join-congress-and-get-friendly-with-big-business-72bf85afeac1)
